Use **any** icons with **Pure CSS** for [UnoCSS](https://github.com/antfu/unocss).

To include your icons, you need to follow the following convention:
- `<prefix><collection>-<icon>` or
- `<prefix><collection>:<icon>`

```html
<!-- A basic anchor icon from Phosphor icons -->
<div class="i-ph-anchor-simple-thin" />
<!-- An orange alarm from Material Design Icons -->
<div class="i-mdi-alarm text-orange-400" />
<!-- A large Vue logo -->
<div class="i-logos-vue text-3xl" />
<!-- Sun in light mode, Moon in dark mode, from Carbon -->
<button class="i-carbon-sun dark:i-carbon-moon" />
<!-- Twemoji of laugh, turns to tear on hovering -->
<div class="i-twemoji-grinning-face-with-smiling-eyes hover:i-twemoji-face-with-tears-of-joy" />
```

## Install

```bash
npm i -D @unocss/preset-icons @iconify-json/[the-collection-you-want]
```

We use [Iconify](https://iconify.design) as our data source of icons. You need to install the corresponding iconset in `devDependencies` by following the `@iconify-json/*` pattern. For example, `@iconify-json/mdi` for [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/), `@iconify-json/tabler` for [Tabler](https://tabler-icons.io/). You can refer to [IcÃ´nes](https://icones.js.org/) or [Iconify](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/) for all the collections available.

```ts
import presetIcons from '@unocss/preset-icons'

Unocss({
  presets: [
    presetIcons({ /* options */ })
    // ...other presets
  ]
})
```

> ðŸ’¡ You can also use this preset alone as a complement to your existing UI frameworks to have pure CSS icons!

## Configuration

The type declaration for the preset options is:
```ts
export interface IconsOptions {
  scale?: number
  mode?: 'mask' | 'background-img' | 'auto'
  prefix?: string
  warn?: boolean
  collections?: Record<string, IconifyJSON | undefined | (() => Awaitable<IconifyJSON | undefined>)>
  extraProperties?: Record<string, string>
  /**
   * Rule layer
   * @default 'icons'
   */
  layer?: string
}
```

### Scale

The default value is `1`, it is used by the preset as `em` unit on icon `width` and `height`. You can change it to
increase/decrease the default size of all your icons.

### Mode

The icons generated by this preset will be scalable and colorable (if theyâ€™re monochrome) instead just a background image.

You can use the following modes:
- `mask`: the preset will always generate the icons using the svg as mask image
- `background-img`: the preset will always generate the icons using the svg as background image
- `auto` (default mode): if the `svg` contains `currentColor`, the preset will generate the icon using the 
  svg as a `mask-image` to allow you to color the icon using the current text color, otherwise the preset will 
  generate the icon using the svg as a background image.

### Prefix

The default value is `i-`, it is used by the preset to scan the source code to detect icons.

### Extra properties

All `CSS` properties added to the `extraProperties` configuration option will be added to all svg `CSS` styles.

### Collections

The way you include the icon collections should be installing it from `@iconify/json` or adding each collection from
its own package using `@iconify-json/<collection>`.

If you include `@iconify/json` or a lot of individual collections may cause degradation, since this preset will need
to traverse all collections to find the requested icon.

This configuration option allow you to hint this preset what collections are you using, and so, it will only find on
these collections.

This option can be also be used to load your own icons, you only need to provide the loader via `Awaittable`, and os you
can for example read your svg icons from some directory.

### Layer

The default value is `-10`: the layer orders will be merged if multiple preset contributes to it, the later one will 
override if the name conflicts.

### Warn

The flag will allow you to be warned when you include a collection  that is not installed or an icon that is missing 
from the collection.

The default value is `false`.
